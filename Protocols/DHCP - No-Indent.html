Basically, every website has an IP address. An IP address is kind of like your home address. Sending letters is a great analogy to how IP addresses work. Think of it like this: You have a good friend and you're in a era where texting didn't exist yet and the only way to communicate to your long distance friend without traveling is through sending letters. In order for you to send them a letter, you must know their address. Once you have their address, you can send them the letter. In order for them to reply, they need to know your address so they can send a reply letter to your house. This is kind of like how IP addresses work. When you connect to a website, your computer will have to figure out what the website's IP address is to send a request. <a href="DNS.html"  class="Link">Learn that process on the DNS page</a>. Once your computer knows the address, they send a request to that website and sets the source IP address as your computer's IP address (the person that sent the request). When the website receives the request, they build a reply (like writing a reply letter) and send it back to the source's IP address. From there, you and the website has formed a connection and start to exchange information as you navigate throughout the website.</p><p>Now that you got a general idea of what an IP address is, I can now explain how DHCP works. In a datacenter, there are servers. One or more of those servers will have DHCP services running on them. A DHCP server would be the server that is responsible for giving out IP addresses to those within the network or, in case of public networks, an IP address to those who connect to the public wi-fi.</p></div><div class="Text-Body"><h1><span class="scaleSize">How DHCP Works</span></h1><p style="text-indent: 0">You can think of the process as this:<br>D for Discover<br>O for Offer<br>R for Request<br>A for Acknowledge<br>Yes, the above does spell DORA. That's an easy way you can remember the important steps of getting an IP address. I'm going to take you through what each one means and what happens during them.</p><p><span style="color:red">Discover</span> is when your computer would send out a broadcast packet (a packet that's sent to everyone on the network) and wait for a responce from any DHCP servers that are out on the network. This step lets your computer (or other devices) know who the DHCP server(s) are.</p><p><span style="color:red">Offer</span> happens when the DHCP server(s) has received your request for an IP address and they pull an IP address from their pool of available addresses and offer that address to you. Note that in most networks that are pretty big, you will often have 2 or more DHCP servers so your computer will get multiple offers. When your computer gets the offer, it randomly picks one of those IP addresses.</p><p><span style="color:red">Request</span> - Once your computer has chosen an IP address, it sends out another broadcast packet asking for that IP address. Everyone will receive that packet but only the DHCP server that offered that address will reply.</p><p><span style="color:red">Acknowledge</span> - When the server has received your request, they will go into their "list" of currently used IP addresses and add the new address to that list which also removes the address from the pool of available addresses to hand out. At this point, the process of getting an IP address is almost complete. The server will send out an acknowledge packet to the sender letting them know that they are free to use that address.</p><p>Execellent! You now have an IP address to use but hold on there, you're not done just yet. Your computer has this new address but it's a bit sceptical about the address and isn't quite convinced that the address is completely unused. As a result, your computer will send out a broadcast packet (known as an <a href="../Terminology_Page3.html#skip2ARP" class="Link">ARP</a>) that asks for a reply from the address you just got. Ultimately, your computer will be hoping for no reply back which lets it know that the address is currently not being used. However, if your computer gets a reply back from someone that is using that address, your computer will have to send a NAK (a negative acknowledgement which basically abandons the address) to the DHCP server letting them know that you no longer want the address because someone else is already using it. Sometimes, there are occurances where a DHCP server might offer the same address to 2 users and sometimes one user starts using that address before the other user gets to confirm that the address is unused. If your computer does reject the address it has, your computer will restart the entire process from the beginning. Once you've got an IP address and your computer has confirmed that no other device is using that address, the process is finally complete and you are now able to use that address.</p></div><button onclick="topFunction()" id="myBtn">Top</button></body></html>
