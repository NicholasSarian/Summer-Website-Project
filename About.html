			Want to know a little about me? Then that is what you shall learn! Hello, my name is Nicholas Sarian. I am currently a student at Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology in Lancaster, PA majoring in Computer and Network Systems Administration. I love working with technology and learn more about it. We will never get away from technology; in fact, we're doing the opposite. Technology is constantly improving and we need people like me to make sure that technology can be fixed when they need fixed. During the last month of my freshman year, we were introduced to HTML and learned a little about it. This sparked a major interest in me and made me want to experiment with HTML. I've done so much experimenting with HTML and I absolute LOVE playing with it. It's so much fun to play with. This website is honestly just a little project I decided to do just because I love working with HTML so much and I love designing a web page.

			In terms of my personal life, I sometimes like to play video games but I don't really play any shooting games. I mostly play Legend of Zelda, Metroid, Mega Man, and Super Smash Bros. As for education, my goal is to get honors and although I've already achieved that goal in every semester I've been in at Thaddeus Stevens, honors still remains to be my goal. I'm constantly trying to go for the highest GPA I can get for 2 reasons: pride and bragging rights (don't worry, I don't shove my GPA in people's faces).
